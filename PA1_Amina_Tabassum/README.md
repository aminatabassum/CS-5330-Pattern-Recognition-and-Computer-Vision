# CS 5330 Programming Assignment 1: Aligning R, G, B Images

# Setup
1. Install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). It doesn't matter whether you use Python 2 or 3 because we will create our own environment that uses python3 anyways.
2. Create a conda environment using the appropriate command. On Windows, open the installed "Conda prompt" to run the command. On MacOS and Linux, you can just use a terminal window to run the command: `conda env create -f pa1_env.yml`
3. This will create an environment named 'cs5330_pa1'. Activate it using the Windows command, `activate cs5330_pa1` or the MacOS / Linux command, `conda activate cs5330_pa1` or `source activate cs5330_pa1`
4. Run the notebook using `jupyter notebook pa1.ipynb` and finish tasks described over there.
5. Submit your finished Jupyter notebook file to Canvas.

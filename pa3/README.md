# CS 5330 programming assignment 3: Fully-Connected Networks


# Setup
1. Install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). You are highly encouraged to use Python 3 because we will create our own environment that uses python3 anyways.
2. Create a conda environment using the appropriate command. On Windows, open the installed "Conda prompt" to run the command. On MacOS and Linux, you can just use a terminal window to run the command: `conda env create -f pa3_env.yml`
3. This will create an environment named 'cs5330_pa3'. Activate it using the Windows command, `activate cs5330_pa3` in the Windows default Command Prompt or the MacOS / Linux command, `conda activate cs5330_pa3` or `source activate cs5330_pa3`.
4. Run the notebook using `jupyter notebook ./pa3_code/pa3.ipynb`and finish tasks described over there.
5. Submit your finished Jupyter notebook files to Canvas.
